      <div class="wrapper"><p>It was 6:00 AM on a soon-to-be warm summer day. As the sun rose, its golden rays melted over
        a neighborhood kid’s bike that lay abandoned on the sidewalk. Greg was comfortably awoken by the sound of his sheep
        baaing, letting him know it was time for breakfast. He threw off his blanket accidentally sending his shark plushy
        flying. Once he hopped out of bed, he went to grab his Air pod Pros, then suddenly debated if he should play a
        record instead. After a moment of thought he decided to throw on some smooth jazz to set the morning straight. 
        Greg danced into the kitchen to grab a pear for breakfast, but not before saying good morning to his goldfish
        sitting on the counter. Heading outside to feed the animals, he spotted a volleyball sitting on his grass. He 
        thought it was strange because he didn’t play sports, so he threw it over the fence assuming it belonged to one of 
        the kids next door. Greg knew they were going to the aquarium today; he wondered what kind of sharks and starfish
        they’d see.  He went to check on his tomato plant in the garden and decided it could use a little water so he went 
        back inside to grab the watering can. As he was filling it up, he noticed a leak, so he went into a drawer to grab
        some duct tape to patch it up.</p><br>

        After watering the garden, Greg decided he would go to the liquor store to get a nice beverage. He grabbed his car
        key and put on his top hat and hopped into his Honda Civic. As he drove around the block, he saw many kids playing in
        their yards. Some had skateboards and lacrosse sticks and he saw one kid trying to start a fire with a magnifying glass.
        Once he made it into town, he glanced up at the Romanian flags displayed everywhere, he loved his country! After leaving
        the liquor store, he packed the wine bottle in the passenger seat and went to the corner store next door to grab a coke 
        glass for the ride home.</p><br>

        Once he was back at home, he sat in front of his computer monitor to send a couple work emails before enjoying the rest
        of his night. He played some guitar and spent some time trying to work on a painting with his new paintbrush but ended up 
        with paint all over his hands instead. After the sky got dark and the moon came up, Greg cleaned up and climbed back into
        bed. “What a nice day,” he thought to himself.</p></div>
